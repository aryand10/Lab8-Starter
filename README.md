### How are graceful degradation and service workers related?

Graceful degradation involves making a web application functional even when advanced features or technology abilities are not available based on what the user employs to access the application. Service workers serve as a means to handle network requests more efficiently in order to allow the web application to function properly offline or under network conditions that are not optimal. Thus, service workers are used to facilitate graceful degradation by maintaining the core functionalities of the web application even when user technology is not optimal for the situation (in this case network is slow or unavailable). Service workers enforce graceful degradation concepts in order to maximize user experience regardless of the user environment when accessing the web application.
